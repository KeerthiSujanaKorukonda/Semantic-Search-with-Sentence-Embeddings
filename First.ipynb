in stratospheric water vapor are caused by a climate feedback or internal variability\", 'According to the study, as carbon levels have risen, the cold air at high altitudes over the tropics has actually grown colder.', 'The lower temperatures at this \"coldest point\" have caused global water vapor levels to drop, even as carbon levels rise.', 'Water vapor helps trap heat, and is a far the strongest of the major greenhouse gases, contributing 36–72 percent of the greenhouse effect.', 'Thus rather than a \"doomsday\" cycle of runaway warming, Mother Earth appears surprisingly tolerant of carbon, decreasing atmospheric levels of water vapor -- a more effective greenhouse gas -- to compensate.', 'Statistical analysis of the rate of warming over different periods find that warming from 1970 to 2001 is greater than the warming from both 1860 to 1880 and 1910 to 1940.', 'Despite the logarithmic relationship between CO2 and surface temperatures, atmospheric CO2 levels are rising so fast that unless we dramatically decrease our emissions, global warming will accelerate over the 21st Century.', 'As a result, the planet as a whole is becoming less reflective and absorbing more sunlight, which is accelerating global warming.', \"While preventing global warming is relatively cheap, economists can't even accurately estimate the accelerating costs of climate damages if we continue with business-as-usual.\", 'Yet the cost of doing something will likely be higher than 6 per cent of GDP\" (Bjorn Lomborg)', 'The measurements of the amount of CO2 made at the Mauna Loa

atmospheric CO2 concentrations since 1959.\", 'The trend in CO2 at Mauna Loa is practically identical to the global trend because CO2 mixes well throughout the atmosphere.', 'The influence of the volcano is easily spotted and removed, together with other even more important spurious influences.', 'Venus is not hot because of a runaway greenhouse.', '\"The solar system oscillates with a 60-year cycle due to the Jupiter/Saturn three-synodic cycle and to a Jupiter/Saturn beat tidal cycle...', 'About 60% of the warming observed from 1970 to 2000 was very likely caused by the above natural

solar activity and global temperature finds that  as the sun grew hotter or cooler, Earth's climate followed it with a 10 year lag - presumably due to the dampening effect of the ocean.\", 'Also found was that the correlation between solar activity and global temperatures ended around 1975, hence recent warming must have some other cause than solar variations.', 'A South African paper has found a

long-term trend.', 'Thousands of coral atolls have \"drowned\" in the past when they were unable to grow fast enough to maintain a presence at sea level', 'There are many lines of evidence which clearly show that the atmospheric CO2 increase is caused by humans.', 'The clearest of these is simple accounting - humans are emitting CO2 at a rate twice as fast as the atmospheric increase (natural sinks are absorbing the other half).', 'There is no question whatsoever that the CO2 increase is human-caused.', 'that atmospheric CO2 increase that we observe is a product of temperature  increase, and not the other way around, meaning it is a product of  natural variation...', 'Once natural influences, in particular the impact of El Niño and La Niña, are removed from the recent termperature

(Judith Curry and David Rose)', '\"The observed data show that CFCs conspiring with cosmic rays most likely caused both the Antarctic ozone hole and global warming...', 'Correspondingly, the global surface temperature has also dropped.\"', 'Models and direct observations find that CFCs only contribute a fraction of the warming supplied by other greenhouse gases.', 'This increases confidence in other peer-reviewed research predicting sea level rise of 80cm to 2 metres by 2100.', \"'Another global warming myth comes crashing down.\", 'No warming since at least 1995, no melting glaciers and now no rising sea levels.', 'The claim that 2.2 conventional jobs are destroyed   for  every new job created in the alternative energy industry is based on a study which relies on incorrect numbers, cherrypicked dates, faulty theory, flawed methodology, and is disproven by real-world examples.', 'for every renewable energy job that the State manages to finance, Spain’s experience...reveals with
